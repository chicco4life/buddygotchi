# Boop doctor (plan/ADAPTERS.md §6): will Boop see this agent's hooks?
#
#   1. Hooks are registered for each agent and point at an existing boop-hook
#      (the installer's own check, through boopdev: run make build first).
#   2. The app is running and its socket accepts.
#   3. A synthetic event goes from boop-hook to the app (seen in its log).
#   4. A harmless command run in the agent shows up in Boop as a hook from
#      this agent's own session (--confirm).
#
# Usage:
#   skills/doctor/doctor.sh [--agent claude|codex] [--state-dir DIR]
#   skills/doctor/doctor.sh --confirm [--agent claude|codex] [--state-dir DIR]
#   skills/doctor/doctor.sh --headless     # checks 1–3 against a throwaway headless app
#
# Exit 0 healthy, 1 broken, 2 armed and waiting for the live step: run one
# harmless command through the agent (echo BOOP_DOCTOR_PING), then --confirm.
# It only reads ~/.claude and ~/.codex. Arming writes one file,
# `doctor-armed`, in the state directory; --confirm removes it, and the app
# drops an arm nobody confirms after a while (ADAPTERS.md §6).
