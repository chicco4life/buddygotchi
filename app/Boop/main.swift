// The Boop app. With no arguments it's the menu-bar app on Bluetooth.

    usage: Boop [--state-dir DIR] [--link ble|usb:SOCKET|none] [--debug]
               The menu-bar app. The owner runs this; it uses Bluetooth by default. With a --state-dir
               other than the everyday one it never installs or repairs the hooks in ~/.claude and
               ~/.codex: they keep reporting to the everyday app's socket, not this one.
           Boop --headless --state-dir DIR [--link usb:SOCKET|none] [--socket PATH] [--personality boop|chatter]
                [--brain jev|scripted] [--name NAME] [--nature sweet|cheeky] [--no-open] [--debug]
               No UI and no Bluetooth. The hook socket defaults to DIR/boop.sock. A new state directory
               is set up with --name (default Boop). --personality overrides the saved one for this run only.
               --brain jev (the default) asks Jev only when BOOP_JEV_KEY holds its key, since headless never
               reads the Keychain; without it Boop does only its rule reactions. --brain scripted answers
               every pass the same way without a network: an excited "Go", for pipeline checks.
               Stops cleanly on SIGINT or SIGTERM. {"dev":"advance","ms":N} on the socket moves the clock forward,
               and {"dev":"tap"} stands in for a tap on the board. A tap while something needs you opens that
               thread on this Mac; --no-open only logs where it would have opened.
               Every event goes to DIR/transcript/<date>.jsonl, read back at the next launch.
           --debug prints everything to this terminal as it happens: each hook and the raw event Boop made
               of it, every line sent to the device, and every view event, pass (with Jev's whole state) and
               action. The events, view events and passes also go to DIR/debug.jsonl, started afresh each
               launch, with the lines sent to the device, status changes and the questions (boopdev watch
               and boopctl dash read it). The last 10 launches' files are kept as DIR/debug.1.jsonl (the latest) to
               debug.10.jsonl, and boopctl day sums them all up by the hour. Jev's state never reaches boop.log.
           Headless, or with --debug, the hook socket also takes {"dev":…} lines from boopctl dash: "answer"
               (a forced pass) and "mood"; and for push-to-talk with no mic, "listen" (the app's button,
               {"dev":"listen","on":true}) and "said" (what the mic heard, {"dev":"said","words":"…"}).
           Boop --snapshots DIR
               Renders the popover's panes and the menu-bar icons to PNGs from fixtures, then exits.
               No runtime, no Bluetooth.
           A flag the chosen way doesn't take stops Boop with this usage, before anything starts.
