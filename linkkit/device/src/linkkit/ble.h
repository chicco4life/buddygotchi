// Bluetooth (linkkit/SPEC.md §8): a NimBLE Nordic UART peripheral named
// <prefix>-XXXX, with no security. Received bytes cross from the Bluetooth
// task to the main loop through a ring, and the main loop does everything
// else, so the kit stays single-threaded. A link the host has gone quiet
// on is dropped (Kit::shouldDrop), so a killed app's leftover link can't
// stop the device advertising.
//
// Built only on an ESP32 with NimBLE-Arduino in the project (ble.cpp is
// empty elsewhere), so the portable part of the kit never needs it.
