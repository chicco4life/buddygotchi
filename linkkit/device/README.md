# LinkKit: the device library

Updated 2026-10-01. The C++ half of LinkKit, for the small device a host
app drives: it reads the host's lines, keeps track of the links, sends
`hello`, decides when each `do` plays (the turn), routes `ev` and answers
the kit's `dbg.*` messages, all as [../SPEC.md](../SPEC.md) says. What the
device draws, plays and says is yours: you write an app that plugs into
it. Boop's firmware is one; a lamp that fits on a page is below.

C++17 and ArduinoJson 7, single-threaded, fixed-size tables. The portable
part has no Arduino headers and runs on a Mac for tests and simulators;
the Bluetooth transport is built only on an ESP32 with NimBLE-Arduino.
It never includes an app's headers: its build fails if it does
(`tools/check_includes.py`, run as the library's `extraScript`).

## What's in it

| File (`src/linkkit/`) | What |
| --- | --- |
| `kit.h`, `kit.cpp` | `Kit`, `App`, `Platform`, `Call`: the protocol and the turn |
| `limits.h` | The spec's numbers (§9): 512-byte lines, 4 waiting, `ttl` 5000 and 1–60000, 60 s `hello`, 30 s host gone |
| `line_reader.h`, `packets.h` | Lines out of a byte stream, and lines into Bluetooth packets |
| `clock.h` | The device clock tools freeze and step (`dbg.clock`), and randomness reseeded with it |
| `codec.h`, `codec.cpp` | CRC-32 and base64, for `dbg.shot` and an app's own debug messages |
| `ble.h`, `ble.cpp` | The Nordic UART peripheral (§8), `<Prefix>-XXXX`; empty off the ESP32 |

## How an app plugs in

The board (or a simulator) owns three things: a `Platform` (a millisecond
counter, the device's id and firmware version), your `App`, and a `Kit`
made from both. It feeds the kit every line from each link and calls
`tick()` once per loop pass; the kit calls your app back.

| Your app's hook | When the kit calls it |
| --- | --- |
| `name()`, `does(names)`, `hello(extra)` | For `hello`: `app`, the `do` names you play, your own fields |
| `begin()` | Once, attached, with the clock at 0 |
| `onState(state, t)` | Every `state`: your whole map |
| `refuse(call, t)` | A call is about to take the turn: return a short reason to skip it, or null |
| `onDo(call, t)` | The call holds the turn, busy: play it. `call.args` is yours, `call.key` is what you report with |
| `advance(t)`, `nextDue(from, to, at)` | Time moves on (in order). `nextDue` says when you'll rest or end the holder by yourself, so a call waiting starts at that exact millisecond |
| `tick(t)` | Once per pass, after `advance`: read inputs, draw |
| `hostGone()` | No line from the host for 30 s |
| `debug(type, msg, from)`, `ping(obj)`, `state(obj, t)`, `reset()`, `shot(s, t)` | Your `dbg.*` types, your vitals and `dbg.state` fields, `dbg.reset`, and the frame `dbg.shot` sends |

And what your app calls on `kit()`, from inside any hook: `rest(key)`
(the holder may be replaced now), `ended(key, how, why)` (it's over),
`cut(why)` (you cut the holder: a button, a tap), `dropWaiting(why, only)`
(every call waiting, or only those from link `only`),
`emit(kind, did, data, injected)` (an `ev` to every live link, or only to
USB for a tool's injected input), `helloChanged()`, `reply(link, text, n)`
for your `dbg.*` replies, and `now()`, `rng()`, `frozen()`. A report for
a key that doesn't hold the turn is ignored, so each `do` gets exactly
one `ended` however your layers overlap.

### A lamp

`examples/lamp/lamp.h`, trimmed of its comments; the unit tests run it
(`test/test_kit`):

```cpp
class Lamp : public linkkit::App {
 public:
  static constexpr uint32_t kBlinkMs = 200;

  const char* name() const override { return "lamp"; }
  int does(const char* const*& names) const override {
    static const char* const kDoes[] = {"blink"};
    names = kDoes;
    return 1;
  }
  void onState(JsonObjectConst state, uint32_t) override { level_ = state["level"] | 0; }
  void onDo(const linkkit::Call& c, uint32_t t) override {  // busy while it blinks
    int times = c.args["times"] | 1;
    times = times < 1 ? 1 : times > 10 ? 10 : times;
    blinking_ = c.key, until_ = t + kBlinkMs * uint32_t(times), at_ = t;
  }
  void advance(uint32_t t) override {
    if (blinking_ && int32_t(t - until_) >= 0) kit().ended(blinking_), blinking_ = 0;
  }
  bool nextDue(uint32_t from, uint32_t to, uint32_t& at) override {
    if (!blinking_ || int32_t(until_ - from) <= 0 || int32_t(until_ - to) > 0) return false;
    at = until_;
    return true;
  }
  void tick(uint32_t t) override { light_ = blinking_ && (t - at_) / (kBlinkMs / 2) % 2 == 0 ? 255 : level_; }
  void press() {  // its own button: the device's doing, so it doesn't take the turn
    if (blinking_) kit().cut("button"), blinking_ = 0;
    kit().emit("press", "stopped", nullptr, false);
  }
  uint8_t light() const { return light_; }

 private:
  uint8_t level_ = 0, light_ = 0;
  uint32_t blinking_ = 0, until_ = 0, at_ = 0;
};
```

On an ESP32 (Arduino), the loop around it:

```cpp
linkkit::Ble ble;
struct SerialOut : linkkit::Out {
  void write(const char* s, size_t n) override { Serial.write((const uint8_t*)s, n); }
};
struct Board : linkkit::Platform {
  uint32_t realMs() override { return millis(); }
  const char* deviceId() override { return ble.id(); }
  const char* fwVersion() override { return "1.0.0"; }
};

Board board;
lamp::Lamp app;
linkkit::Kit kit(board, app, /*frozenClock=*/false);
SerialOut usb;
linkkit::LineReader line;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(460800);
  kit.setOut(linkkit::Link::kUsb, &usb);
  if (ble.begin("Lamp", "lamp")) kit.setOut(linkkit::Link::kBle, &ble);  // Lamp-XXXX
}
void loop() {
  while (Serial.available())
    if (line.feed(char(Serial.read()))) kit.handleLine(line.line(), line.length(), linkkit::Link::kUsb);
  ble.poll(kit);  // connects, drops a quiet link, and one line from Bluetooth
  kit.tick();
}
```

A host sends `{"t":"state","level":40}`, the lamp answers `hello`, and
`{"t":"do","id":1,"name":"blink","args":{"times":2}}` blinks it twice,
then `{"t":"ev","kind":"ended","data":{"id":1,"how":"done"}}`. A second
`blink` sent meanwhile waits and starts the millisecond the first ends.

## The turn, from the app's side

A call holds the turn from `onDo` until you `ended` it (or the kit ends
it: a `now` call cuts it while busy, `dbg.reset`). Call `rest(key)` when
the part that matters is over: from then anything may replace it, and it
ends `done`. Things the device does on its own (a tap's reflex, a held
button) don't take the turn; cut the holder only when you actually cut
it. `refuse` is asked right before a call would take the turn, so it can
look at what's on screen then; it may change your own state (Boop's reply
ends listening even when it's refused). Queued calls keep their own copy
of `args` (512 bytes each, 2 KB in all), parsed again when they start.

## Building and testing

Add it to a PlatformIO env with ArduinoJson 7 (and NimBLE-Arduino on the
board, for `Ble`):

```ini
lib_deps =
    symlink://../linkkit/device
    bblanchon/ArduinoJson @ ^7.0.0
```

Boop's firmware does that in both its envs, the board's and the Mac's
(its unit tests and simulator).

The library tests on its own, on the Mac, from its own PlatformIO
project (`platformio.ini` here, which apps don't use): `test/test_turn`
(every rule of §4), `test/test_kit` (lines, `hello`, links, `ev`, the
app's words escaped, `dbg.*`, the lamp) and `test/test_helpers` (lines
out of bytes and into Bluetooth packets, CRC-32 and base64, the clock),
with a fake platform and app (`test/kit_fakes.h`):

```sh
pio test -d linkkit/device -e native          # the kit's own tests
python3 linkkit/device/tools/check_includes.py   # the include check, by itself
```

In Boop's checkout, run PlatformIO through `firmware/tools/pio.sh`, which
keeps its packages there; `make -C internal fw-test` runs these after
Boop's own suites.
