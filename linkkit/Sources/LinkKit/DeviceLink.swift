/// The host's side of the protocol (SPEC.md §5): keeps the device's
/// picture true with `state`, asks it to play things with `do` and hands
/// on what it says.
///
/// - `state`: sent on every change, at once when the link comes up, in
///   answer to every `hello`, and again once 10 s have passed (`tick`).
///   One too long for a line is never sent (SPEC.md §2): the last that
///   fit stands.
/// - `hello`: asked for (the host's bare `{"t":"hello"}`, SPEC.md §3) when
///   the link comes up, and again every 10 s until one comes, since a
///   device that still counts the host as there (an app relaunched within
///   30 s, or one taking over a Bluetooth link macOS kept) doesn't say it
///   unasked. Checked against the kit's version and the app's name. A
///   device that doesn't fit (a `kit` other than 1, another app, or
///   firmware the app finds too old, `incompatible`) still gets `state`, so
///   a device flashed while the link stays up hears the host and says its
///   new `hello`, but no `do`, and its `ev`s are dropped: `trouble` says
///   why.
/// - `do`: each gets an id and exactly one `Outcome`: the device's
///   `ended`, or a failure here (no link, no hello yet, a name the device
///   doesn't play, the link dropping, no answer by its `ttl` plus 60 s).
/// - `ev`: every one but `ended` goes to `onEvent`, from a device that fits.
///
/// Call everything on one queue. A transport calls back on its own thread,
/// so the owner hops to that queue and passes each line to `receive` and
/// each change of connection to `connection`, and calls `tick` about once
/// a second. Every call takes the owner's clock, in ms:
///
/// ```swift
/// let link = DeviceLink(app: "lamp", transport: SocketTransport(path: "/tmp/lamp.sock"))
/// link.onEvent = { ev in if ev.kind == "tap" { … } }
/// link.transport?.start(onLine: { line in queue.async { link.receive(line, now: clock()) } },
///                       onConnection: { up in queue.async { link.connection(up, now: clock()) } })
/// link.update(state: ["level": 40], now: clock())
/// link.do("blink", args: ["times": 2], now: clock()) { outcome in … }
/// ```
///
