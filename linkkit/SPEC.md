# LinkKit: the spec

Updated 2026-10-01. The contract between a host (a Mac app) and a small
device with a screen, a light or a speaker: four messages, how the device
decides what plays when, and the rules both sides keep. It's language
neutral: the Swift host library (`Sources/LinkKit`) and the C++ device
library (`device/`) both implement it, and a port to another language
matches this file. [README.md](README.md) is the overview. It was pulled
out of Boop, a desk creature whose app and firmware are one app on it.

## 1. The idea

The host tells the device how things are and asks it to play things. The
device draws them however it likes and says what happened. Neither side
gives orders: a `do` is a request the device may play, make wait, skip,
or draw its own way.

```
host → device    state   how things are now (sent whole, on every change and every 10 s)
                 do      please play this (a request; exactly one answer comes back)
device → host    hello   who I am and what I can play (a host's bare hello asks for it)
                 ev      something happened: a tap, a hold, how a request went
```

Tools also send `dbg.*` messages over USB (§7).

## 2. Lines

- Every message is one JSON object on one line, UTF-8, ending in `\n`,
  with its type in `t`. A receiver drops a trailing `\r`, skips empty
  lines, and buffers a line that spans packets or reads until its newline.
- A line is at most **512 bytes** either way, not counting its newline; the
  device drops a longer one whole, and a host never sends one (a `do` that
  would be longer fails at once). Only `dbg.*` replies over USB may be
  longer (§7).
- Receivers ignore types and fields they don't know, so a new optional
  field or type never breaks an older peer.
- **The kit owns a few field names and the app owns the rest.** `state` is
  entirely the app's. `do` carries the app's details in `args`, and `ev` in
  `data`. `hello` has five kit fields; any other field in it is the app's.
- There are no app-defined message types. An app extends the protocol by
  choosing `state` keys, `do` names and `ev` kinds. `dbg.*` is the one
  namespace an app adds types to.
- A number field that must be an integer in a range (`id`, `ttl`, `kit`,
  `ended`'s `data.id`) and isn't one reads as missing.

## 3. Messages

### `hello`: device → host

```json
{"t":"hello","kit":1,"app":"boop","id":"b00p-54fe","fw":"1.4.0","does":["react","starting","listening"],"voice":"1aace295d219"}
```

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `kit` | The protocol version, 1 (§6) |
| `app` | Which kind of device this is. A host drives only the `app` it was written for |
| `id` | The device's permanent id |
| `fw` | The firmware version |
| `does` | The `do` names it plays, at most 32. The whole `hello` fits in one line |
| any other field | The app's (Boop's `voice`) |

`does` lists names only; what each name means lives on the host. A
`hello` that wouldn't fit in one line would be dropped on the way, so the
device sends it without the app's fields, or not at all when even the
kit's don't fit, and says so in `dbg.ping` (`hello_long`, its whole
length, §7).

**A host asks for it** with a bare `{"t":"hello"}` (any field in it is
ignored); the device answers with its `hello` on that link. A host sends
one first on every link-up, before its `state` (and may ask again while
none has come, as a lost line would leave it waiting), because the device may
still count the link as live and so not greet the host's first line
(§5): a host relaunched within 30 s over USB, or one taking over a
Bluetooth link the system kept up. Older firmware ignores the type (§2).

### `state`: host → device

```json
{"t":"state","base":"working","mood":"calm","busy":1,"vol":6}
```

The app's own map, sent whole every time, so a lost or late line is fixed
by the next. The kit reads none of it; any `state` counts as the host
speaking (§5).

### `do`: host → device

```json
{"t":"do","id":44,"name":"task_complete","play":"next","ttl":5000,"args":{"outcome":"success"}}
```

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | 1–2147483647. The host picks it, starting somewhere random each launch and counting up, so an id an earlier launch left on the device isn't reused. Every `do` from a host has one and gets exactly one `ended` (§4). A `do` without a valid id still plays but gets no answer (handy typed by hand) |
| `name` | One of `hello.does`. Any other gets `skipped`, `unknown` at once |
| `play` | `now`, `next` or `if_free` (§4). `next` when missing or unknown |
| `ttl` | How long a `next` may wait for the turn, in ms, 1–60000. 5000 when missing. A host sends it only with `next`; the device ignores it otherwise |
| `args` | The app's details, handed to its handler untouched. `{}` when missing |

### `ev`: device → host

```json
{"t":"ev","kind":"tap","did":"poked"}
{"t":"ev","kind":"tap","did":"dip","data":{"on":44}}
{"t":"ev","kind":"ended","data":{"id":44,"how":"cut","why":"tap"}}
```

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `kind` | What happened. The kit reserves `ended`; every other kind is the app's |
| `did` | Optional: what the device already did about it on its own |
| `data` | Optional: the app's details, or `ended`'s |

The device sends an app's `ev` on every live link (§5), and an `ended` on
the link its `do` came in on.

## 4. The turn: who decides what plays

The device decides, because it's the only one that knows when something
has finished. The host never times the device's outputs.

**One call holds the turn at a time.** The kit doesn't decide what's on
screen: the app draws whatever layers it likes. The call holding the turn
is **busy** (don't cut me) or **resting** (the part that matters is over:
anyone may take over, and this ends `done`). Calls that wait for the turn
queue in order of arrival.

| `play` | Turn free or resting, nothing waiting | Otherwise |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `now` | Takes the turn | Takes the turn at once; a busy holder ends `cut`, `now`. Calls waiting keep waiting |
| `next` | Takes the turn | Waits at the back of the line. Still waiting after its `ttl`: `skipped`, `late` |
| `if_free` | Takes the turn | `skipped`, `busy` |

- **Taking the turn.** First the app's `refuse` is asked. A reason ends the
  call `skipped` with that reason, and the holder is left alone. Otherwise
  a resting holder ends `done` (a busy one, for `now`, ends `cut`, `now`),
  the call becomes the holder, busy, and the app's `onDo` runs.
- **The line moves** whenever the holder rests or ends: the oldest waiting
  call whose wait hasn't passed its `ttl` tries to take the turn; one that
  has is `skipped`, `late`. A refused head is skipped and the next tries.
- **The app reports** through four calls: `rest(id)` (the holder may be
  replaced now), `ended(id, how, why)` (it's over: `done`, or `cut` with
  why), `cut(why)` (the app cuts the holder, `cut` with why, as for a tap)
  and `dropWaiting(why)` (every waiting call ends `skipped` with why; or
  only those from one link, when what drops them reached only that link's
  host). A report for an id that isn't the holder, or has already ended,
  is ignored: each `do` gets exactly one `ended`.
- **At most 4 calls wait.** A fifth ends the oldest waiting as `skipped`,
  `full`.
- **Same id again.** A `do` whose id matches a call still holding or
  waiting comes from a later launch of the host (ids never repeat within a
  launch): the old call is forgotten without an `ended`, and the new one
  is handled as usual.
- **`dbg.reset`** ends the holder `cut`, `reset`, and every waiting call
  `skipped`, `reset`.
- **Things the device does on its own** (a tap's reflex, a held button)
  don't take the turn: the app draws them, and cuts the holder with
  `cut(why)` only when it actually cuts it.

**How a call can end:**

| `how` | `why` | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `done` | — | It played through, or it was resting and something replaced it |
| `cut` | `now` | A `now` call took the turn |
| `cut` | `reset` | A tool sent `dbg.reset` |
| `cut` | the app's | The app cut it: `tap`, `needs_you` |
| `skipped` | `late` | It waited longer than its `ttl` |
| `skipped` | `busy` | It was `if_free` and the turn was busy |
| `skipped` | `full` | Too many calls were waiting |
| `skipped` | `unknown` | The device doesn't have that name |
| `skipped` | `reset` | A tool sent `dbg.reset` while it waited |
| `skipped` | the app's | The app's `refuse` or `dropWaiting` |

`why` is a short lower-case word; app reasons use `[a-z_]` too.

## 5. Lifecycle

| When | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| A link comes up | The host sends a bare `hello` (§3), then its latest `state`, at once |
| The device hears a host's `hello`, or its first line on a link it didn't count as live (any type but `dbg.*`) | It sends `hello` on that link, once for a first line that is a `hello` |
| The host gets a `hello` | It answers with its latest `state`, so a device that rebooted catches up at once |
| While the link is up | The host sends `state` on every change and at least every 10 s. The device sends `hello` again when something in it changes, and 60 s after the last one on the link the host last spoke on |
| 30 s with no line from the host | The device treats the host as gone: it tells the app, and drops a Bluetooth link so it can advertise again |
| The link drops | The host ends every `do` still waiting for its `ended` as failed (the device may play on) |
| No `ended` by a `do`'s `ttl` (5000 ms for `now` and `if_free`) plus 60 s after it was sent | The host gives up on it as failed: a line was lost. Only the `ended` stops that wait (resting never reaches the host), so a call that may play longer than its `ttl` plus 60 s must end sooner, or be split into several calls |

A link is *live* for device → host messages while it's connected
(Bluetooth) or the host has spoken on it in the last 30 s (USB).
Answering the host's first line instead of announcing at connect means
the `hello` is always heard: by the time a host sends a line, it's
listening. The host's own `hello` covers a host that finds the link
already live, which the device has no way to tell from the host before.

## 6. Versioning

- There's one number, `hello.kit`. Adding a field, an `ev` kind, a `do`
  name or a message type never changes it; it changes only when something
  that exists changes meaning.
- Capabilities are names, not numbers: a host checks `does` before
  sending. An app's own compatibility goes in its own `hello` field.
- A host that meets a `kit` it doesn't know, or another `app`, keeps the
  link and keeps sending `state` (so a device that's flashed while the link
  stays up still hears it and answers with its new `hello`), but sends no
  `do`, drops the device's `ev`s, and says the firmware is too new, too
  old or not its device. A
  `do` asked for before a `hello` has come fails at once. How to recognise
  an app's older firmware (Boop's sent `status` before there was a
  `hello`) is the app's business.

## 7. Debug messages (USB only)

Types starting `dbg.` are for tools and tests over USB; over Bluetooth the
device ignores them. Each gets one reply with the same `t`; an unknown one
gets none. The kit handles five, and an app adds its own.

| Request | Reply |
| --- | --- |
| `{"t":"dbg.ping"}` | `{"t":"dbg.ping","kit":1,"fw":…,"up":ms,…}` plus the app's vitals, and `hello_long` (the whole `hello`'s length) when the `hello` doesn't fit in a line (§3) |
| `{"t":"dbg.state"}` | `{"t":"dbg.state",…,"clock":{"now":T,"frozen":bool},"rx":{"state":N,"do":N},"turn":{…}}`: the app's fields first, then the kit's clock, the `state` and `do` lines it has read, and the turn (below) |
| `{"t":"dbg.clock","freeze":T}`, `{"step":MS}`, `{"run":true}` | `{"t":"dbg.clock","now":T,"frozen":bool}`. A frozen clock runs again by itself after 60 s with no `dbg.*` |
| `{"t":"dbg.shot"}` | The app's current frame, when it draws one |
| `{"t":"dbg.reset"}` | `{"t":"dbg.reset"}`, after §4's reset and the app's own |

`dbg.state`'s `turn` is `{"holder":{"id":44,"name":"react","resting":false},"waiting":[{"id":45,"name":"react","left_ms":3200}]}`,
`holder` null when the turn is free.

## 8. Transport

Both links carry the same lines, and the device answers on the link a
message came in on.

- **Bluetooth:** the Nordic UART Service (`6E400001-B5A3-F393-E0A9-E50E24DCCA9E`;
  RX `…0002` host → device, written without response; TX `…0003` device →
  host, notified). The device is the peripheral and advertises as
  `<Prefix>-XXXX`, the prefix the app's. It asks for a 247-byte MTU and
  cuts notifications to MTU − 3.
  - The host cuts each line to the write size it's allowed, and queues
    lines so a burst never loses part of one. A newer `state` replaces one
    not yet started; no other line is dropped, since the host waits for
    every `do`'s `ended` (§5). Once states merge only `do`s pile up, so a
    backlog past 4 KB means the link is stuck: the host gives it up and
    connects again, which ends what waited as failed (§5).
  - A device still connected to the system doesn't advertise, so the host
    first takes over a link the system holds to one, and scans otherwise.
    It's up once subscribed to TX. An attempt that isn't up within 10 s,
    or fails on the way, is cancelled and tried again, and a device whose
    UART service changed (a reflash) is connected again. After a drop or
    a failed attempt the host looks again after 1 s, doubling to 5 s, and
    back to 1 s once a link is up.
- **USB:** the board's serial port, owned by a bridge process that shares
  it on a Unix socket, so tools and the host can both use it:
  `linkkit-bridge`, or any bridge that keeps its rules.
  - Every whole line from the board goes to every client, and every whole
    line from a client goes to the board whole, so two clients' lines
    never interleave.
  - The bridge never waits on a client: one that falls 4 MB behind (it
    stopped reading) is dropped, so it can't stall the others.
  - The host connects to the socket, and again every second while it
    can't. A write that can't finish within 250 ms drops the connection,
    which comes back a second later, so a stuck bridge can't freeze the
    host.
