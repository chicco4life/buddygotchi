"""Copying the voice pack onto the board's microSD card over USB (`boopctl
card`; documentation/VOICE.md §8, documentation/PROTOCOL.md §5): `dbg.card` `begin`, a `put`
per chunk with its CRC-32, then `end` with the whole file's size and CRC-32,
which the board checks by reading the file back before it swaps it in.

It's slow, hours for the whole pack (documentation/VOICE.md §8 has the rate), so a
card reader (`voicegen.py --card`) comes first. A few `put`s are in flight
at once. Every reply says how much the card holds, so a line lost on the
way (the CH340 drops a run of bytes now and then) costs a resync, not the
copy; and a copy that was cut off goes on where it stopped."""
