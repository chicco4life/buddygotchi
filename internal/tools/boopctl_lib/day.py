"""`boopctl day` (plan/VERIFICATION.md §2): what Boop did in a day, and why,
from debug mode's logs (plan/harness/HARNESS.md §9). It reads the state dir's
debug.jsonl and the earlier launches' debug.<n>.jsonl, oldest first, and
sums up one local day by the hour: cheers, working chatter, the brain's
reactions and their faces, chirps, mood changes, passes, and the brain's
reactions that didn't happen; then each mood change with its cause, each
time something needed you and how long it took to clear, and why reactions
didn't happen. What the dashboard forced is counted apart from the brain.

It reads only the lines, like the dashboard (dash/feed.py): what was sent
to the device (`sent`), the transcript (`event`, `pass`, `action`,
`settle`) and `status`. A failed action's message is its reason
(harness/HARNESS.md §4), so that one is shown; no other message is parsed."""
