# The designs

The device's faces come from the animation bank,
[`internal/boop-design/boop-sound-bank-v4/`](../../../boop-design/boop-sound-bank-v4/README.md):
its generator makes every design's SVG, and `facegen` turns them into
`firmware/assets/faces.h`, the popover's tiles and the Mac's loop lengths
([plan/DEVICE.md](../../../../plan/DEVICE.md) §6). Nothing here is drawn
by hand, and no SVG is checked in: `facegen` runs `../bank.mjs` into
`../build/` (ignored) each time.

- `manifest.json`: the designs, in the device's order, which `facegen`
  writes and `sfxgen` reads: each one's mood, state, variation (from 1
  within its mood and state), name, length in seconds, the host fact it's
  for (`outcome`, success or failure, for task_complete; `ctx`, new_task,
  session or continuation, for starting), its voice window (`voiceMs`,
  when a line that comes with its animation starts, which `sfxgen` puts in
  `sfx.h` and `facegen` in the Mac's `FaceLoops`), and its SVG dialect
  (`v2`, the first pack's; `v3`, the older moods' newer states; `v4`, the
  new moods' flip-books).

13 moods × 22 states, 770 designs. The older seven moods keep the first
pack's designs byte for byte (the bank's `qa/v3-fingerprints.json`, which
`facegen` checks) and have one or two of most newer states; the six new
moods have three of each. Asleep and no app look the same in every older
mood, and in every new one.

What picks a design is the mood and the state, and a variation is picked
at random, never the last one, among those for the host fact if there
is one ([plan/BEHAVIORS.md](../../../../plan/BEHAVIORS.md) §2). To take a
new version of the bank, update it in `internal/boop-design/`, run its
checks, then `make -C internal faces` and `node internal/tools/sfxgen/sfxgen.mjs`.
