"""Builds Boop's voice (plan/VOICE.md §3) from the recorded voice bank.

The bank, internal/boop-design/assets/boop-voice-v1/, has whole recorded
takes, each a word, a sound, a phrase or a swear performed in one mood.
Every take in its manifest is read from its robot-soft WAV (8-bit,
11.025 kHz), the near-silence around it trimmed, saturated and normalised
so it's as loud on the small speaker, and stored as 8-bit unsigned
samples. Two things come out; rerun this whenever the bank or a mapping
changes:

    python3 internal/tools/voicegen/voicegen.py [--card /Volumes/CARD] [--wav-dir DIR]

- .build/voice/voice.bin: the pack the board plays from its SD card
  (at /boop/voice.bin; VOICE.md §8): every take's samples, bubble text
  and mouth (open or shut every 20 ms), found by id. `--card` also copies
  it onto a mounted card. It's built, not checked in; `make -C internal
  voice` makes it for the simulator and the firmware's tests.
- app/BoopKit/Voice/Takes.swift, checked in: each take's id, text, part
  and answer, kind, mood, the finish it needs and its length, which the
  Mac picks from, and the pack's version, which the board reports.

Every take answers one of the brain's two questions (harness/DECISIONS.md
§3): how Boop feels (`say.feeling`) or what NOW is about (`say.about`),
by the bank's intent (FEELING, ABOUT). Needs you's takes (`attention`)
are in the pack, but Boop never says them. Six takes were recorded in
moods Boop doesn't have; MOOD_OF gives them one, by the owner's word
(2026-09-29).

`--wav-dir` also writes every converted take as a WAV, for listening.
