Ordinary neighbors still require context/pacing. Dramatic neighbors require fresh
strong edge-specific evidence. Staying is implicit at every node. Families and
intensity labels are static design metadata, not LLM-selected numeric controls.
Faces are V3 review candidates; body descriptions below are choreography targets.
